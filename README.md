# Godot-Portal

![](https://i.imgur.com/KE4u2Dg.png)

## Description
This is a buggy and imperfect demo of teleportation portals in the Godot Engine, the portals are not at all perfect and there are problems.

I did my best to comment the portal.gd script, but that's the only script I added comments to.<br />
Also, I'm not an amazing programmer or Godot user so parts of the code may be wack watch out.

## Controls
Use `left/right mouse button` to shoot portals<br />
Use `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` to move<br />
